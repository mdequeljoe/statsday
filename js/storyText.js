    step1 : "The story begins in 2007; here the diagram shows the net flows between the main sectors of the Portuguese economy as well as the Rest of the World sector",
    step2 : "the blue arcs represent the sectors' total holdings of financial assets, while the orange arcs represent their issuance of liabilities",
    step3 : "the sectors' role as either a net lender or net borrower is represented by the outside arc which is the difference between financial assets and liabilities",
    step4 : "since all financial assets (except monetary gold) must have a counterpart liability, the flows run from the asset arcs to the liability arcs"

    label : "2000 - 2007",
    step1 : "The period of 2000-07 roughly comprises the period between Portugal joining the Euro Area up to the initial tensions in the global financial markets",
    step2 : "During this period, the financial sector was carrying out its typical intermediary role raising funds mainly from the Rest of the World",
    step3: "and channelling these funds to non-financial corporations"

    label : "2000 - 2007",
    step1 : "There was significant asymmetry between domestic and foreign financing sources",
    step2 : "domestic saving and lending were insufficient to finance the needs of domestic sectors",
    step3 : "hence the vast majority of funding was coming from abroad"
  },
  frame2 : {
   label : "2008-10",
   step1 : "The second period covers the international financial turmoil up to 2010",
   step2 : "As compared to the previous period, the overall financing needs of the country were larger than before with those of the government reaching 10% of GDP",
   step3 : "To cover the financing gap, the financial sector stepped in, channeling funds to this sector",
   step4: "This created a 'crowding out' effect as now less credit flowed to the private sector"

  frame3 : {
    label : "2011 and 2012",
    step1 : "The third period started in 2011 with the beginning of the Economic and Financial Assistance Programme to Portugal",
    step2 : "The main consequence of this was the replacement of the funding of the government by foreign international institutions rather than the domestic financial sector",
    step3 : "Due to the programme, the general government became a net lender with respect to the financial sector by granting financial support to banks"
  },
  frame4 : {
    label : "2013 and 2014",
    step1 : "The Assistance Programme to Portugal ended in 2014 and the flow of funds was very different as compared to previous periods",
    step2 : "Portugal became a net lender starting in 2012 and the government deficit decreased",
    step3 : "Non-financial corporations became net lenders as a consequence of a sharp decline in non-financial investments",
    step4: "And households increased their saving rate as a result of a contraction in private consumption"
